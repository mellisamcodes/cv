## The Philosophy

My investment philosophy is simple: own quality assets, diversify intelligently, and let time work for you.

I don't try to time the market. I don't chase hot tips. I build a portfolio that lets me sleep at night while still capturing long-term growth.

## Current Allocation

Here's how I'm positioned going into 2026:

### Equities (70%)

**US Large Cap (35%)**
- S&P 500 index funds
- Focus on quality and profitability
- Core holding, rarely touched

**US Small/Mid Cap (10%)**
- Russell 2000 exposure
- Higher growth potential
- More volatile, smaller position

**International Developed (15%)**
- Europe, Japan, Australia
- Currency diversification
- Currently undervalued relative to US

**Emerging Markets (10%)**
- China, India, Brazil, etc.
- Highest growth potential
- Highest risk, sized accordingly

### Fixed Income (20%)

**Investment Grade Bonds (10%)**
- Corporate and government mix
- Stability and income
- Rebalancing fuel during downturns

**Treasury I-Bonds (5%)**
- Inflation protection
- Tax advantages
- Limited to $10K/year

**High Yield Bonds (5%)**
- Higher income
- Equity-like risk
- Diversification benefit

### Alternatives (10%)

**Real Estate (5%)**
- REITs for liquidity
- Income and inflation hedge
- Different cycle than stocks

**Commodities (3%)**
- Gold and broad commodity exposure
- Inflation protection
- Portfolio insurance

**Cash (2%)**
- Opportunity fund
- Emergency buffer
- Dry powder for crashes

## Rebalancing Rules

I rebalance when:
- Any asset class drifts 5%+ from target
- Annually at minimum
- After major market moves

I don't rebalance for small fluctuations. Transaction costs and taxes matter.

## What I'm Watching

### Bullish Signals
- Corporate earnings growth
- AI productivity gains
- Demographic shifts in emerging markets
- Infrastructure spending

### Bearish Signals
- Elevated valuations
- Geopolitical uncertainty
- Debt levels globally
- Potential recession indicators

## The Mistakes I've Made

Learning from my past errors:

1. **Overconcentration** - Lost 40% of a position by not diversifying
2. **Panic selling** - Sold in March 2020, missed the recovery
3. **Chasing performance** - Bought hot sectors at peaks
4. **Overtrading** - Fees and taxes ate into returns

Now I have rules that prevent emotional decisions.

## For Different Life Stages

### Just Starting (20s)
- 90% equities, 10% bonds
- Maximum risk tolerance
- Time heals all wounds

### Building (30s-40s)
- 80% equities, 20% bonds/alternatives
- Start adding income
- Protect what you've built

### Approaching Retirement (50s)
- 60% equities, 40% bonds/alternatives
- Income becomes priority
- Sequence of returns risk

### In Retirement (60s+)
- 40-50% equities, 50-60% bonds/income
- Capital preservation
- Sustainable withdrawal rate

## The Bottom Line

No portfolio is perfect. The best allocation is one you can stick with through bull and bear markets.

I review annually, adjust minimally, and trust the process.

The goal isn't to beat the market every year. It's to build wealth consistently over decades.

Stay the course.
